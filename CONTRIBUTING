CONTRIBUTING TO THE DSLANG PROJECT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though DSLANG is licensed as BSD-2-Clause, it is presently very much a
private endeavor, and it is all copyrighted by Ryan V. Bissell in the
year of its authorship.  At least during the early stages of development,
contributions from other parties are not likely to be accepted. Think of
it as performance art, on public display.

The above is expected to change, eventually.  When it does, I will decide
then whether or not contributors must agree to declare that their
contributions are available under the same BSD-2-Clause terms, and/or
ask them to formally assign copyright (with attribution.)

You are, of course, free to use it for your own nefarious purposes,
subject to the terms spelled out in the 'LICENSE' file.
